    <h1>Homeless Essentails</h1>
    <p>
      Problem Description: The general topic I want to tackle in this project is
      the overflow of information on how to best help homeless individuals and
      other individuals who are need of support resources to help them maintain
      a healthy and sustainable way of life. Currently, there are website all
      around the internet that have websites specializing in unique problems in
      the homeless community. Some resource tries to find homeless people jobs,
      some resources tries to find homeless shelters, and some resources tries
      to find soup kitchens, however not one resource that I have found combines
      all these attributes into one website that is easy to understand. For
      example, on the
      <a href="https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/"
        >homeless shelter directory</a
      >
      , they try to tackle homelessness by listing out homeless shelters for
      people to find in their local state and city. However, the thing the cite
      lacks are other resources like food banks and medical clinics in those
      areas. Another resource that helps individuals who may need assistances is
      <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank"
        >Feeding America</a
      >
      in their website their goal is finding local food banks for individuals,
      but what they lack are other resources outside to help with other needs.
      As we can see in these resources, the information needed to help homeless
      is not unavailable but more scattered. Homeless individual would need to
      know what to search up and look at multiple cites to find pieces of
      information that they need, instead of having one resource with everything
      they need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proposed application: The users of the applications are going to be
      predominately homeless individuals with addition to people who need
      additional support in finding essentials to survive. When these users go
      on this website, they will be able to view information on food banks,
      homeless shelters, soup kitchens, etc. The resources that I will be using
      are: 

      <ul>
        <li>https://www.opendatanetwork.com/search?q=food+banks</li>
        <li>https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/directory-of-homeless-drop-in-centers-0786e
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>A few things users can do on the website are:</p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>find local food banks</li>
          <li>find local homeless shelters</li>
          <li>find local medical centers</li>
          <li>filter different categoreis to find specific information that they
              want
          </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>By creating this website, I hope this will solve the issue of having
      information scattered everywhere in the internet and allow people to find
      a resource for them that contains all their needs.</p>
